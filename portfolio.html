			<p class="aboutP">Hi, I’m Marcus. I am a student at iO academy on the full stack track course, I am currently working on this website as part of my first project week. By the end of this course I will be able to make something much better than this so it does not really matter what I write here because even if I do use this site as my actual portfolio I will change everything else I just need content to fill a box which is why I have not used any abbreviations like “don’t” or “haven’t” and I have actually written out “do not” and “have not” to make it longer.</p>
