			<h2 class="aboutH">About Me</h2>
			<p class="aboutP">I am a full-stack developer currently training at iO Academy. In my spare time I enjoy going on long walks in the country and playing video games. I have always had an interest in technology, when I was a child I went with my dad to the gadget show in Birmingham and loved seeing all of the tech that they had there. As well as this I also love problem solving and looking for creative ways to figure things out.</p>

			<h3>Word Nerd</h3>
			<p>This was a group project where we made a wordle-like game, mainly using vanilla JavaScript.
				I had several roles throughout the project, one of which was creating the pop-up modal that
				displayed the instructions for the game whenever the page was opened or whenever the user
				clicked the '?' button. The content and styling was done with HTML and CSS, while the functionality
				of it opening on page load and on click was done with JavaScript. I had several other roles,
				and we all did lots of pair programming to help us all learn more from the project.</p>

			<h3>Job Finder</h3>
			<p>In this project we made a job search website. The website allowed users to search jobs with
				a search bar and click on individual jobs to open a modal which showed all of the details
				for that specific job, we did this using React and SASS. One of my roles on this project was
				making a button to change what was displayed on the page, this made the page go between
				displaying all jobs and the most recent jobs, also changing the contents of the button so that
				it would say see all jobs or see recent jobs</p>

			<h3>Dino Finder</h3>
			<p>This was an OOP PHP project where we made a website that took data from a database of
				dinosaurs that had been provided for us and displayed it on the front end, similarly to
				the React project there was functionality that allowed the user to click on an individual
				dinosaur to find out more information as well as a search bar that would display dinosaurs
				based on a full or partial match to its name. During this project I spent lots of my time pair
				programming with the other members of the scrum team, including work on our high fidelity
				wireframe and work on the search bar.</p>

			<h3>iO Academipsum</h3>
			<p>iO Academipsum was a full stack project at iO Academy where four of us created a lorem ipsum generator
				based on words and phrases our classmates and teachers frequently used. We used the MERN stack as the
				data in the database wasn't relational, so there was no need to use a SQL database and we were all
				comfortable using React for the front end. The website allows you to select how many paragraphs of
				ipsum you would like and the press generate which then makes an API request to our back end, the back
				end will then respond with the requested amount of randomly generated paragraphs, these are then
				displayed on the front end. We worked together through all of the work so that we all had a strong
				understanding of how the front and back end of the project works.</p>
