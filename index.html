			<p class="aboutP">Hi&#44; I’m Marcus. I am a student at iO academy on the full stack track course&#44; I am currently working on this website as part of my first project week. By the end of this course I will be able to make something much better than this so it does not really matter what I write here because even if I do use this site as my actual portfolio I will change everything else I just need content to fill a box which is why I have not used any abbreviations like “don&#39;t” or “haven&#39;t” and I have actually written out &#34;do not&#34; and &#34;have not&#34; to make it longer&#46;</p>
