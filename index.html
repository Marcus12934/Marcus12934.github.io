			<h2 class="aboutH">About Me</h2>
			<p class="aboutP">I am a full-stack developer currently training at iO Academy. In my spare time I enjoy going on long walks in the country and playing video games. I have always had an interest in technology, when I was a child I went with my dad to the gadget show in Birmingham and loved seeing all of the tech that they had there. As well as this I also love problem solving and looking for creative ways to figure things out.</p>

			<h3>Word Nerd</h3>
			<p>This was a group project where we made a wordle-like game, mainly using vanilla JavaScript.
				I had several roles throughout the project, one of which was creating the pop-up modal that
				displayed the instructions for the game whenever the page was opened or whenever the user
				clicked the '?' button. The content and styling was done with HTML and CSS, while the functionality
				of it opening on page load and on click was done with JavaScript. I had several other roles,
				and we all did lots of pair programming to help us all learn more from the project.</p>
